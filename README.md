Hello, I’m @M0r3C0l0urs
I like gaming and anime as my stay at home activities, soccer and exploring places I have never been as my outside activities.
I’m currently learning C++ as I want to make my own games in the future, C++ also feeds into other programming languages so I
can expand should into freelance while I make games.
I’m looking to collaborate on making games, making game engines and learning as much from experts in the field.
