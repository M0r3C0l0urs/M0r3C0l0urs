Hello, I’m Zane
I love gaming and anime as my stay at home activities when I am not working and soccer, exploring places I have never been and swimming as my outside activities.
I’m currently learning pyhton as I want to start working in industry, Pyhton is a good start for me as I don't have coding experience and will also help me understand other programming languages
